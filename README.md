## Description
The emergence of e-commerce has created large-scale implications into the world of business and technology as a whole. With Amazon on the forefront of most e-businesses, it has become an inevitability that businesses transition from a brick and mortar store to include an e-commerce model into their business operations. Amaznot is a proof-of-concept in e-commerce, showcasing the relative ease in deploying an online shopping site and the challenges that come along with it. As is customary, Amaznot allows users to order items from a wide selection of products. It is built as part of the partial requirements of SOEN 341 to exhibit the software process. It contains many features present in real, production e-commerce websites, such as user log-in, item filtering, and order listing, among others.
