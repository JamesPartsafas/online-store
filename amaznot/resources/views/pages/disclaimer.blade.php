        Amaznot is a proof-of-concept in e-commerce, showcasing the relative ease in deploying an online shopping site and the challenges that come along with it. It is built as a partial requirement of SOEN 341 to exhibit the software process. It contains many features present in real, production e-commerce websites, such as user log-in, item filtering, and order listing, among others.

        The Canadian Copyright Act (R.S.C., 1985, c. C-42) allows the use of material from a copyright protected work (literature, musical scores, audiovisual works, etc.) without permission when certain conditions are met.

    <p>
        In accordance to section 29 of the Canadian Copyright Act, fair dealing for the purpose of research, private study, education, parody or satire does not infringe copyright.
    </p>
    <p>
        Specifically, Section 29.4 (1) states that it is not an infringement of copyright for an educational institution or a person acting under its authority for the purposes of education or training on its premises to reproduce a work, or do any other necessary act, in order to display it.

    Moreover, as per Section 29.21 (1), it is not an infringement of copyright for an individual to use an existing work or other subject-matter or copy of one, which has been published or otherwise made available to the public, in the creation of a new work or other subject-matter in which copyright subsists and for the individual — or, with the individual’s authorization, a member of their household — to use the new work or other subject-matter or to authorize an intermediary to disseminate it, if
        <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
            <li>
            the use of, or the authorization to disseminate, the new work or other subject-matter is done solely for non-commercial purposes;
            </li>
            <li>
            the source — and, if given in the source, the name of the author, performer, maker or broadcaster — of the existing work or other subject-matter or copy of it are mentioned, if it is reasonable in the circumstances to do so;
            </li>
            <li>
            the individual had reasonable grounds to believe that the existing work or other subject-matter or copy of it, as the case may be, was not infringing copyright; and
            </li>
            <li>
            the use of, or the authorization to disseminate, the new work or other subject-matter does not have a substantial adverse effect, financial or otherwise, on the exploitation or potential exploitation of the existing work or other subject-matter — or copy of it — or on an existing or potential market for it, including that the new work or other subject-matter is not a substitute for the existing one.
            </li>
